        Senior Software Developer | Software/System Engineer | AI and Machine Learning Enthusiast | Crafty software builder

        I want to build systems that move things forward. Massive legacy systems that maintain the status quo, is not my thing. Let's build something new instead.

        Self taught in machine learning subjects. Have been diving into building Agentic systems, speech and text processing, RAG backed bots and other fun stuff.
        Experience with building sw using OpenAi and open source local LLMs.
        Mistral, Mixtral, LLAMA, StarCoder, Whisper etc.

        About me:
        - A pragmatic and generalist that gets things done. 
        - I like to analyze and build new things. 
        - Comfortable working independently or in teams.
        - Proficient in SW architecture and design.
        - I like a little structure, but rely on my own judgment.
        - Memorization is not my thing, but creativity is.
        - I emphasize on building aesthetic and quality software.

        Proficient with a broad variety of tech and tools like:
        C#, processing pipelines and message bus, WPF, SQL, JS, React, Node, Electron, Java, Python.
        AWS, Docker, Gradle, Maven, AzureDevops/VSOnline, vector databases.

        Looking for roles where creativity drives progress and innovation is the goal.
